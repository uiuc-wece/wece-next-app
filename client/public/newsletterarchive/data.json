Or just want to delve deeper into python and turning large data files into meaningful conclusions? Join us for the Spotify Data Investigation workshop! If you want to learn about your own spotify listening history, we recommend you request your data through settings in advance, as it can take up to 30 days for spotify to send you the data. Don't worry, we will have sample datasets during the workshop so if you do not use spotify or your data hasn't been sent yet you can still learn, and just use the programs we develop on your data later!",
