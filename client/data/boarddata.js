On campus, I am involved with Engineering Ambassadors and was a lab assistant and counselor for WYSE Camps (Worldwide Youth and Science in Engineering). I interned at Burns & McDonnell the past summer and worked in substation design, and it was such a rewarding experience. My interests are in power and energy, and I'm also planning to do a concentration during my time here. I joined WECE my first semester (Fall 2020) and it has been such a good time! Mt favorite experience in WECE has definitely been Engineering Open House! While I was not on the technical side of things, I staffed our booth and it was so awesome representing WECE and all the amazing things we do. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just wanna chat! :)",
