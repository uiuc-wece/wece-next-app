I've been in WECE since my freshman year, as a mentorship chair, then was mentorship director for the next two years. I've loved the impact we've had on the department and people around us, and I love getting to make a welcoming environment for everyone. In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching tv or movies (some of my favs are the Mentalist, Suits, Friends, and Pitch Perfect), and watching sports.",
