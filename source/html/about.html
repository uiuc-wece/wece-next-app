            In 2002, WECE was founded to promote and inspire women in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Our objective is not only
            to encourage women to pursue a degree in ECE, but to also be a source of assistance in reaching academic and
            career goals. The WECE organization provides members with opportunities to make social connections within the
            department, advance technical skills, and network professionally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Involvement with WECE gives members a chance to make new friends and contacts within the department. WECE hosts a number
            of social events such as the Fall Banquet and Spring Semi Formal as well as other regular social meetings. Whether
            you are an incoming freshman or graduate student, being a part of a community of people that supports women in
            ECE is a powerful tool in furthering your personal and academic success.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with the social aspect, WECE is also committed to assisting the development of our memberâ€™s technical skills. WECE
            organizes various events each year including technical workshops and tech talks by companies such as Square and
            Google. We recognize the importance of having well-rounded, technical knowledge and strive to help our members
            gain as much relevant experience as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            WECE helps its members form valuable professional connections. It can sometimes be difficult to attain positions in the corporate
            world, which is why WECE makes it a priority to establish relationships with companies in order to help members
            do the same. This includes hosting guest speakers and organizing luncheons with influential people in the field
            who support women in ECE. We also work in cooperation with various companies, such as Microsoft and Goldman Sachs,
            to provide our members with as many internship and job prospects as possible.
