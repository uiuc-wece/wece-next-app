					    	WECE is currently working with ECESAC and HKN on a freshman mentoring program! The program consists of meetings during the semester, as well as an online communication platform. In the meetings, freshman have dinner (which we provide) with student mentors and get some advice about courses, clubs, etc. The online communication platform will provide a means for them to ask questions anytime that mentors can respond to. The plan for the mentoring program consists of 2 parts: (1) large group meeting(s) in the ECEB 3002 ballroom and (2) an online communication portal (like Piazza).
