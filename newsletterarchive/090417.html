				    	<p><center>
				    		If you are interested in learning more about design, we have an opening for a design assistant to our Creative Design Director. This is a role comparable to a committee member however there is only one opening. We are looking for someone to shadow the Creative Design Director position and collaborate on design work. There will be a lot of inter-committee collaborations because of the nature of the design role and, while prior design software experience is desirable, it is not required. Please contact Ying Chen at <a href="mailto:ychen250@illinois.edu?" target="_blank">ychen250@illinois.edu</a> for more information.
